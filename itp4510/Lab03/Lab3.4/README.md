### Q4
A proper binary tree contains N nodes. What is the number of leaf nodes in the tree? What is the
number of non-leaf nodes in the tree?

```
Leaf nodes = N/2+1 (N must be an odd number, so take the integer of N/2.)
Non-leaf nodes = N/2
```

### Q5
A complete binary tree has a depth of 8. What is the total number of nodes in the tree? Give the
relationship of the depth and the total number of nodes of a complete binary tree in a mathematic
expression.
```
Total nodes = 2^(8+1) â€“ 1 = 511
```

### Q6a
Draw the array of the binary tree if it is implemented in an
array.

### Q8
Outline an algorithm of searching an item in a Binary Search Tree.
```
BinaryNode search (BinaryNode t, key x)
begin
if t is null
  return null; 
if (x is less than t.data.key)
  return search(t.left, x);
else if (x is greater than t.data.key)
  return search(t.right, x); 
else
  return t;
end
```

### Q10
Give the postfix and prefix expressions as well as the expression tree.

((A + B) * C) / (D + E) * F

```
          [*]
          / \
        [/]   [F]
        / \
       /   \
      /     \
    [*]     [+]
    / \     / \
  [+]  [C] [D] [E]
  / \
 /   \
[A]   [B]

pre-order traversal on the expression tree to yields the prefix expression

Prefix expression: * / * + A B C + D E F
