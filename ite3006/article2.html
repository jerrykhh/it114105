	<p>Once again, The Oscars took time to honor the many talents we lost during the previous year, the lives they touched and the art they made or made possible. You can see the full Oscars 2019 In Memoriam gallery below, and find even more galleries in the Oscars Red Carpet section.</p>

	<pre>Former SNL stars Tina Fey, Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler were the first presenters at the 91st Academy Awards. The trio poked fun at the Oscars before introducing the Actress in a Supporting Role category. “Welcome to the one millionth Academy Awards!” said Fey.

“So just a quick update, in case you’re confused: There is no host tonight,” Rudolph said. “There won’t be a popular movie category. And Mexico is not paying for the wall.”

Added Poehler: “And we won’t be doing awards during the commercials, but we will be presenting commercials during the awards. So if all the winners could please say, ‘Hellman’s Mayonnaise: We’re on the side of food,’ instead of speeches, that would be great.”

<pre>As promised, Queen + Adam Lambert ROCKED the opening number of the 91st Oscars! From the moment the first chords of "We Will Rock You" rang through the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, excitement levels rocketed as everyone leapt to their feet.

Queen's formation in 1970, and subsequent rise to fame is documented in Best Picture nominee BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. Grammy-nominated singer and "American Idol" alum Adam Lambert has performed with Queen (original band members Brian May and Roger Taylor) since 2011, including two hugely successful world tours.

Queen + Adam Lambert closed out the opening with a rousing performance of the anthem "We Are the Champions," which had the entire audience on their feet, waving their hands, and cheering.
