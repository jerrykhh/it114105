          <h1>Movie Club</h1>
          <p>The DPFC screens films that have a connection with the Dartmouth Park area of London, England - primarily films made by locals but also films shot in the area. Since launching the DPFC we’ve been astonished at how many talented filmmakers live here...and more keep popping out of the woodwork! At our events we enjoy wine, soft drinks, popcorn and home made brownies while the film is playing, then after the film finishes we have a lively Q&A session, typically with the filmmaker themselves.

Our events are free - so anyone can come - but we do ask people to contribute what they think the evening is worth, and what they can personally afford, when they leave.

The club aims to build a community of likeminded people and have fun watching films together. We also set up the club to support the Highgate Library which had its budget cut recently.</p>
<p>It's for anyone who wants to develop their screen craft and help further their career. Whether you're a working actor searching for the final piece of the puzzle, a musical theatre artist ready to take the leap into Film and TV, or someone that has had limited training and is keen on becoming a professional in the industry, Film Club is for you!</p>
